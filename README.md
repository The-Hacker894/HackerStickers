# HackerStickers
HackerStickers iMessage Sticker Pack

# How to Install
To install HackerStickers you will need [Xcode 9.2](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) or later (as this supports iOS 11.2 and newer)

Once you have installed Xcode open the app and install the additional components (this may take some time)  

After installing the Xcode Additional Components go to the status bar and click **File** then **Open** and find the file named `HackerStickers.xcodeproj` and open it.

After opening the project, you may encounter errors some errors. To fix these errors go to the status bar and click **Xcode** then **Preferences**. Once you are here navigate to the **Accounts** tab and add your Apple ID as an account. After this, exit out of the Preferences window and add your Apple ID as the Team in Project Settings.

If you are still experiencing issues try setting the iOS Deployment Target to iOS `11.2`. Anything earlier will return an error.

Before you can build HackerStickers to your iOS device, you will need to change the package indentifier to *literally anything* and change the run target to your iOS Device.

Now you're all set to build HackerStickers. Go to the Status Bar and click **Product** then click **Run**. If everything has been done correctly Xcode will now build HackerStickers. Once the installation has concluded you should be able to open up iMessages and see the HackerStickers icon in your iMessages Apps.
